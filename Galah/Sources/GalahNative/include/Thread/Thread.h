 * NOTE: This stuff is fairly minimalistic and relies on ownership to maintain thread safety.
 * As a guide, nativethreadptr, and shouldExit are 'owned' by the main/owner thread, and can only
 * be read by the child thread. hasJob, job, and jobArg can only be set by the owner thread, and
 * cleared by the child thread. hasJob relies on the CPU's atomic set instruction to remain thread safe,
 * and should be checked for false by the owner thread before "setting".
