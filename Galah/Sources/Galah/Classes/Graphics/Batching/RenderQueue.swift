 A RenderQueue represents an array of batched items that will be drawn on a particular frame. It's basically a frame buffer of sorts.
 Platforms are supposed to implement the platform specific approach so as to push the information to the renderer as quickly as possible.
 There are (usually) three RenderQueues in our render pipeline.
