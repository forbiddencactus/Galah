# Galah Roadmap
  
## Short term roadmap:

- Transient nodes & components. At the moment node mutation triggers immediate archetype memory reshuffles, which is slow. 

## Long term roadmap:

(From easier to hard / lower prio / time consuming)

- Initial support for PC, Mac, Linux, and mobile. 
- 2D with sprite batching, atlasing, and custom materials
- Write shaders in HLSL. (SPIR-V Cross)
- Easy to use UI layer. 
- Forward rendering pipeline
- Input layer for keyboard, touchscreens, and gamepads. 
- 2D physics with Liquidfun, ported to fit Galah.
- 3D physics with PhysX. 
- 3D Audio, and one day, support for MOD files?
- An editor, built on top of Galah's own tech.
