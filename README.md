# Galah
  
Galah is a lovingly hand crafted Swift game engine for PC, Mac, Linux, and mobile. It's designed for videogame zinesters, dreamers, bedroom coders, indies, game designers, housewives, and everyone else! It's also designed to be useable, fast, and portable. It's free and open source and built with love. ❤︎
