# Galah
A proof of concept for a multiplatform 2D engine written in Swift. The plan is to compile for Mac & iOS (Metal), and Linux and Android (Vulkan).

At the moment this is a bit of a fun toy for me to fiddle with, so treat this code as such (e.g. I'm not responsible if your computer blows up if you choose to use this).

Check the develop branch where all the action is happening (will probably use master for milestone commits at some point).
